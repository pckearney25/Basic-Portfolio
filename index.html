He has also been a Senior Research Director at Exelixis in San Francisco, where his team identified 3 clinical development candidates abd built a 4.5 million compound screening library that was the basis for over 25 clinical development candidates. Adrift in Kansas City, Patrick is trying to fit in and is currently looking for new opportunities in the fields of biotechnology, pharmaceutical research, medical devices, animal health, and agricultural technology. For fun, and to prepare for his next entrepreneurial endeavor, he is currently struggling through a "Learn to Code" boot camp. He is also an avid gardener, chef, cyclist, yoga student, and beekeeper. Peace out, y'all.
