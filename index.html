                I enjoy working with people on the challenging development of new products or the successful repurposing of mature ones (including
                myself) for new uses. In my career, I have been a senior-level pharmaceutical research director whose teams
                have identified three clinical candidates, built an unprecedented 4.5 million compound screening library,
                and generated over $42 million dollars in revenue. After moving to Kansas City MO several years ago, I founded
                a company to develop chemical technologies that would let scientists more easily use the enormous marketplace
                of commercial chemical reagents in their work. Currently, in addition to looking for new career opportunities
                in the Kansas City or Denver metro regions, Iâ€™m formally studying full-stack web-development through the
                University of Kansas Professional and Continuing Education Program with a goal of creating applications that
                make scientific information (often found only in the hard-to-read academic formats of the last century) more
                accessible/understandable to everyone.
